                <p>I'm sure you've figured out my name by now but just in caseÂ you missed it up top, my name is Eric! I'm a full-stack web developer who graduated from the UC Irvine Coding Bootcamp.</p>
                <p>When I'm on screen, I enjoy building websites, throwing my ideas for design onto a page, and always trying to learn new techniques and adapt to the ever-changing world that we web developers deal with.</p>
                <p>When I'm off-screen, I enjoy spending time with my wife and getting outdoors. From hiking in the woods to taking a drive to discover a new place.</p>
                <h5 style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Fun Fact: I'm actually from California! Born and raised in Orange County. In January of 2021, my wife and I embarked on a new adventure by moving across the country.</h5>
